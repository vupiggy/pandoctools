```

# `amsthm` Example

## Circle

```{.theorem type=definition item=Plane}
In mathematics,
a plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far.
```

```{.theorem type=definition item=Circle}
A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are a given distance from a given point, the centre;
equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant.
```

## Chord and tangent line

```{.theorem type=definition item=Chord}
A line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle,
thus dividing a circle in two sements.
```

```{.theorem type=definition item="Tangent line"}
A tangent line to a circle is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point,
never entering the circle's interior.
```

# Figure Example

## Tangent Line

See `the figure below`{=html}`Figure~\ref{fig:tanl}`{=latex},
We have a theorem about tangent line to a circle:

```{.theorem type=theorem item="Tangent line to a circle"}
A line is tangent to a circle
if and only if the line is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.
```
